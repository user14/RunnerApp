How do you run the project?
In order to run the project on your phone, you'll need to first clone it and then add two API keys for:

... the Runique API (access granted after course purchase)
... Google Maps (needs to be got from Google Cloud Console - instructions in the course)
Then simply include them in local.properties:

API_KEY=<RUNIQUE_API_KEY>
MAPS_API_KEY=<GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>
Afterwards, build the project and you're ready to use it.
